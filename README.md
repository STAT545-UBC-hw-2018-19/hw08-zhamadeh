Homework \#8 for STAT 547
================

### Dataset explored in this repo

This repo contains data on tumour microRNA expression in 133 samples of primary breast cancer tissue. Detailed here, as an interactive bioinformatics [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rhostam/primary-breast-cancer-vs-normal-breast-tissue/home), and here, as the findings of a [primary research article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26056355) in the Clinical Chemistry journal.

### Shiny app created in this repo

I used this data to develop a shiny [app](https://zhamadeh.shinyapps.io/hw08-zhamadeh/) that reshapes and tidys this [data](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-zhamadeh/blob/master/GSE58606_data.csv) in order to provide a friendly user interface to select one or more of the four microRNAs highlighted in the research paper and display a distribution of their expression levels accross all 133 samples. This interactive app overlays multiple microRNA distributions, provides a table of these values and includes an [image](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-zhamadeh/blob/master/www/image.png) detailing the importance if microRNAs in the cell.
